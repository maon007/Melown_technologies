### Description
- In dataset.zip, there are images and their pixel-wise labels along with classes.json containing a class description.
- The task is to explore the data and train a semantic segmentation model with these images.
- The number of images is not sufficient to develop a reliable prediction model but it should be used more as an illustration. 

### Semantic Segmentation Model 

- the code is more to illustrate the solution.
- run file is **main.py**
